| [Vacation Rental Market NYC](https://github.com/iles777/Data-projects-TripleTen-/tree/main/Vacation%20Rental%20Market%20NYC) | This project was created to help a client analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The client was interested in investing in several properties but would like some guidance on what types of properties they should be targeting. My role was to analyze data collected on current Airbnb listings to identify useful insights. |
| [Zuber](https://github.com/iles777/Data-projects-TripleTen-/tree/main/Zuber%20SQL) | The purpose of this project was to use SQL to find patterns in the available information from competitors to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. |
| [eCommerce Cohorts](https://github.com/iles777/Data-projects-TripleTen-/tree/main/eCommerce%20Cohorts) | In this project, I analyze raw transaction logs to turn event logs into business metrics by creating a conversion funnel, preparing the data for cohort analysis and calculating retention rates. |
| [Saving Super Store](https://github.com/iles777/Data-projects-TripleTen-/tree/main/Saving%20Super%20Store) | The purpose of this project was to review superstore’s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy. |
| [Super Store Return Rates](https://github.com/iles777/Data-projects-TripleTen-/tree/main/Super%20Store%20Return%20Rates) | What is causing the high number of returned orders at the Superstore? In this project, I prepared an analysis to understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders. |
| [Shopify](https://github.com/iles777/Data-projects-TripleTen-/tree/main/Shopify) | This project uses PowerBI to review the landscape of apps on the Shopify platform from publicly available Shopify websites data to determine the key factors of success with Shopify apps. | 
| [Zomato](https://github.com/iles777/Data-projects-TripleTen-/tree/main/Zomato) | This project includes research into Zomato’s customers and their ordering behavior for marketing/promotional efforts. Tableau was used to create multiple interactive data visualizations and a simple, easy-to-use interactive dashboards that enables the end user to easily make data-driven decisions. |
