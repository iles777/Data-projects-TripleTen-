# Vacation Rental Market NYC

This project was created to help a client analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. The client was interested in investing in several properties but would like some guidance on what types of properties they should be targeting. My role was to analyze data collected on current Airbnb listings to identify useful insights.

Executive Summary:

The following analysis is to determine what property type should be targeted within Manhattan, NYC for purchase with the intention of renting via Airbnb for investment purposes. Based on the data, the best property to target would be a one-bedroom property in the Lower East Side neighborhood. This type of property is estimated to bring in $66,349 in revenue per year. However, finding the right property is not the only consideration.

To maximize revenue, it is important to have your property available for bookings on Fridays & Saturdays, to become (and maintain the status) an Airbnb Superhost, and have your property instantly bookable as properties with these features have higher occupancy rates and market value. If a property is located within a larger building it should have a doorman as these properties have slightly higher review scores for check-in.

Finally, beware of price hiking when great reviews roll in. Higher review scores by themself do not necessarily warrant higher prices. In fact, higher review scores also don't directly affect occupancy rate either. However, ratings are very important to earn and maintain status as a Superhost (must maintain a 4.8 review score), which will in turn warrant charging higher prices.
